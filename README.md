- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cwolfe28
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning how to code in languages other than JS and to build on my skills from a introductory computer science course. 
      I want to eventually transition from a career as a chemist into computer science.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently taking the Harvard CS50 course to try and decide if this is the right field for me.
